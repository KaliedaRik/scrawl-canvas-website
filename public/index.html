                <h1>Welcome to the Scrawl-canvas Library</h1> 

                <p>Scrawl-canvas is a Javascript library for working with the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element. The library:</p> 

                <ul class="svelte-hudiqi">
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Defines a set of factory functions for creating a wide range of graphic artefacts and effects, which can be drawn on a canvas.</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Includes an adaptable - yet easy to use - protocol for positioning, displaying and animating artefacts and effects across the canvas.</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Adds functionality to make &lt;canvas&gt; elements <strong>responsive</strong>, adapting their size to their surrounding environment while remaining fully <strong>interactive</strong>.</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Helps make &lt;canvas&gt; elements more <strong>accessible</strong> for both keyboard and AT users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why use Scrawl-canvas?</h2> 
                <div class="text-grid svelte-hudiqi">
                    <div>
                        <h4 class="svelte-hudiqi">Working with the native Canvas API is hard work</h4> 

                        <p>Particularly when the desired result is more complex than a couple of coloured boxes in a static display.</p> 

                        <ul class="svelte-hudiqi">
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Working directly with the canvas-related APIs means writing significant amounts of Javascript boilerplate code.</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">&lt;canvas&gt; elements can be resized and styled using CSS, but changing the CSS size does not affect the element's drawing dimensions - leading to ugly results.</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Events work on the canvas, not on the graphical objects within the canvas - we cannot use those objects as links or hot-spots (click/tap events), we cannot give them the equivalent of a CSS hover state (focus/blur events), we cannot drag-and-drop them around the display (move events).</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Tracking a user's interaction with the various parts of a canvas display, for analytics and research on web page performance, is particularly difficult.</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">We cannot easily save and share displays, effects and animations; each &lt;canvas&gt; element's output is tightly coupled to the code that defines that output.</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi"><strong>Of most concern,</strong> canvases are entirely graphical - visual - by nature; they come with <strong>significant accessibility issues.</strong> Given the ever-stricter requirements for websites to be accessible to all users, this makes using a canvas to present important information a dangerous proposition.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                        <h4 class="svelte-hudiqi">But the benefits of using canvases for graphical displays and animations are also great</h4> 

                        <ul class="svelte-hudiqi">
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Canvases are part of the DOM (unlike Flash).</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">They are natively wired for events and user interactions.</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">They use immediate mode redering (which makes them very quick).</li> 
                            <li class="svelte-hudiqi">The canvas-related APIs are designed to be used with Javascript.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <h4 class="svelte-hudiqi">Scrawl-canvas overcomes these barriers</h4> 

                        <p>Scrawl-canvas is fast, and developer-friendly. It's suitable for building infographics, games, interactive videos - whatever we can imagine for a 2D graphical presentation. And it is modular - we can break the code for a particular effect into its own module file which can be reused in other projects.</p> 

                        <p>Scrawl-canvas offers all of this while never losing its hard focus on making the &lt;canvas&gt; element <strong>accessible, responsive and fully interactive</strong> while at the same time offering a <strong>pleasant developer experience</strong>.</p>

            <section class="svelte-hudiqi">

                <h2>Responsive canvas elements</h2> 

                <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element</a> was not designed to be responsive. When we add a canvas to a web page, we give it fixed width and height values, which define its drawing (bitmap) dimensions.</p> 

                <p>To make the web page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive</a>, so that it can look good across a range of browser sizes and device screens, we need to define a range of sizes using <b class="svelte-hudiqi">relative proportions</b> - such as CSS percentage values.</p> 

                <p>This approach fails for the &lt;canvas&gt; element because browsers will stretch its drawing area to match the CSS-defined dimensions, which often leads to an ugly, distorted result.</p> 

                <p>Scrawl-canvas allows us to define the canvas dimensions in CSS, then displays the canvas output in that area in a variety of ways using a <b class="svelte-hudiqi">fit attribute</b> (which parodies the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit">object-fit</a> property):</p>

                <img class="svelte-14si1qy" src="assets/sc-static-site-fit-canvases.png" alt="responsive canvases - snapshot of four canvases, each showing the effects of a different 'fit' attribute">

                <p>Fitting the canvas into a space in the web page is one thing. Positioning the artefacts and effects that make up the canvas's display is another. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML5 Canvas API</a> includes many functions for creating graphical elements; all of them use absolute pixel values to define, size and position them on the canvas.</p> 

                <p>Scrawl-canvas simplifies the Canvas API, supplying a range of <b class="svelte-hudiqi">factory functions</b> to create 'artefacts', 'styles' and other objects - including animations and tweens - which can be used together to create a canvas display.</p> 

                <p>Once created, we can position these objects on the canvas in a number of ways:</p> 

                <ul class="svelte-hudiqi">
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi"><b class="svelte-hudiqi">Absolute positioning</b> - using the canvas like a coordinates grid (which is how the Canvas API positions objects).</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi"><b class="svelte-hudiqi">Relative positioning</b> - place objects on the canvas using relative percentage values; if the canvas size changes, the objects stay in the same place relative to the canvas.</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi"><b class="svelte-hudiqi">Reference positioning</b> - use an artefact as a reference against which other artefacts can position themselves; when we update the reference artefact's position, the other artefacts update their position values automatically.</li>
                </ul> 

                <p>The canvas below uses all these techniques to create its display. The result is entirely responsive - try resizing the browser window to see how the scene looks at smaller and larger viewport sizes!</p>
            </section> 

            <section class="svelte-hudiqi">

                <h2>Accessible and interactive canvas elements</h2> 

                <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element really comes into its own when we add user-interaction features to it:</p> 

                <ul class="svelte-hudiqi">
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Hotspots - defined areas within the display which users can hover over or click/tap to reveal additional information, trigger a tween animation, cause changes in other parts of the web page ... or even navigate to a different web page.</li> 
                    <li class="svelte-hudiqi">Mouse/touch cursor tracking - attach a graphical artefact to the mouse cursor, or drag-and-drop artefacts around the canvas (or even between different canvases).</li>
                </ul> 

                <p>Building this functionality for a normal, static canvas display is difficult enough. To build it for a responsive canvas display may seem impossible, given modern time and resource constraints.</p>

                <p>Scrawl-canvas makes building such features easier!</p> 

                <img class="svelte-1a8az88" src="assets/sc-static-site-navigation-canvas.png" alt="Accessible canvas - snapshot of a kitchen scene with accessible links to related Wikipedia articles">

                <p>More importantly, Scrawl-canvas does a lot of heavy lifting to make those features <b class="svelte-hudiqi">accessible</b> to users who cannot - for whatever reason - view the canvas display. Links can be made accessible via the keyboard; graphical text is (by default) copied into the DOM so it can be accessed by screen readers. Every Scrawl-canvas canvas comes with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA attributes</a>.</p> 

                <h4 class="svelte-hudiqi">Tracking user journeys</h4> 

                <p>Once we've built the canvas, we can add third-party tracker functionality to help record user journeys through its display, record click convertions - whatever the client needs to monitor the effectiveness of their site or campaign.</p>
