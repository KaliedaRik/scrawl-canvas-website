<h3 tabindex="0">Videos in web pages</h3>

<p>Video has become a key component of modern web design &ndash; used judiciously, video content can help increase visitor numbers and conversions.</p>

<p>Adding video to a website has become a lot easier since HTML5 introduced the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video">‹video› element</a>. And <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Responsive/responsive_design_building_blocks#Responsive_imagesvideo">making video more responsive</a> is fairly simple to achieve through good CSS and HTML coding.</p>

<p>Even so, getting video right in a web page can be tricky &ndash; especially when the page needs to cater to users accessing the site with very different hardware. For instance, some smartphone-based browsers will prevent a video playing until the user directly interacts with it, or break the video out of the page to make it fullscreen as soon as it starts playing.</p>

<p>The ‹canvas› element has had functionality to display image data from ‹video› elements since it was first introduced, in the same way as it can access data from ‹img› elements.</p>

<p>The reasons for displaying video in a canvas are many and varied, but also come at a cost: <b><i>when we display a video in a canvas, we abandon the ‹video› element's inbuilt playback control panel.</i></b> If we want to give the user control over how they watch the video, we need to replicate those controls &ndash; either with graphical control buttons as part of the canvas display, or through a linked set of DOM-based controls.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">Scrawl-canvas and videos</h3>

<p>Just as for images, Scrawl-canvas uses the <b>Picture entity</b> to display video output in a ‹canvas› element. We investigated the Picture entity in some detail in a previous lesson <i>("Using images in Scrawl-canvas")</i>.</p>

<p>As usual, we'll start with a very basic html page, containing a responsive ‹canvas› element (the user can change the element's dimensions by dragging its bottom-right corner):</p>

<pre><code>‹!DOCTYPE html›
‹html lang="en"›
‹head›
  ‹meta charset='utf-8'›
  ‹meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width,initial-scale=1'›

  ‹title›Fun with video‹/title›

  ‹style type="text/css"›
    canvas {
      background-color: lemonchiffon;
    }
    .canvas-container {
      overflow: hidden;
      resize: both;
      border: 1px solid red;
      width: 600px;
      height: 400px;
      min-height: 200px;
      min-width: 200px;
      max-height: 400px;
      max-width: 800px;
    }
  ‹/style›
‹/head›

‹body›
  ‹div class="canvas-container"›
    ‹canvas 
      id="mycanvas" 
      data-scrawl-canvas
      data-is-responsive="true" 
      data-base-width="640" 
      data-base-height="360" 
      data-fit="contain"
    ›‹/canvas›
  ‹/div›

  ‹script type="module"›
    import * as scrawl from 'https://unpkg.com/scrawl-canvas@8.13.0';

    const canvas = scrawl.findCanvas('mycanvas');
    const namespace = 'video-example';
    const name = (n) => `${namespace}-${n}`;

    canvas.setAsCurrentCanvas();

    scrawl.makeRender({
      name: name('animation'),
      target: canvas,
    });
  ‹/script›
‹body›
‹/html›
</code></pre>

<p>Just as for images, Scrawl-canvas can import video files either from the DOM (the recommended method, as it allows us to define the ‹video› element in more detail, for example different source files), or programmatically in the Javascript code.</p>

<p>For this project, we'll use the second method:</p>

<p><ins>Note: video downloaded from <a href="https://pixabay.com/videos/swans-ducks-water-white-bird-1287/">Pixabay</a>. Originally uploaded by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/inspiredimages-57296/?tab=videos">InspiredImages</a>.</ins></p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›

  [... canvas setup]

  <b>const myvideo = scrawl.makePicture({

    name: name('video'),

    <strong>videoSource: './swans.mp4',</strong>

    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',

    copyWidth: '100%',
    copyHeight: '100%',
  });</b>

  [... render animation]

‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>The key difference between loading an image and a video is that we assign the video file to a different attribute: <code><b>videoSource</b></code> rather than <code><b>imageSource</b></code>.</p>

<p>Beyond that change, videos and images are much the same, using <code><b>copyStartX, copyStartY, copyWidth, copyHeight</b></code> attributes to define which parts of the video we copy over to the canvas.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-04/02.png" alt="A canvas dispalying the first frame of a video" /></p>

<p>The big difference is that videos can be played and paused. They also come with audio soundtracks and (sometimes) subtitles which makes accessing the video a lot easier for non visual/audio-centered users.</p>

<p>... So, how can we start our video playing when the page loads?</p>

<p>The Picture entity includes a number of functions we can use to trigger video functionality, and access video attributes. These include:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><code><b>video_muted</b></code> &ndash; a Boolean value which switches audio playback on and off.</li>
  <li><code><b>video_loop</b></code> &ndash; another Boolean; when set this will cause the video to loop its playback instead of stopping when it reaches the final frame of its playback</li>
  <li><code><b>videoPlay()</b></code> &ndash; start video playback.</li>
  <li><code><b>videoPause()</b></code> &ndash; pause video playback.</li>
  <li><code><b>video_duration</b></code> &ndash; retrieve the video's playback length (in seconds).</li>
  <li><code><b>video_currentTime</b></code> &ndash; the current point in the video's playback (whether playing or paused).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's try to start our video playing as soon as it loads:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  const myvideo = scrawl.makePicture({

    [...]

  })<b>.videoPlay()</b>;

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>... Oops?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-04/03.png" alt="An image of the console error message after attempting to autoplay the video" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes">link supplied in the error message</a> tells us that the (in this case: Chrome) browser blocks many attempts to autoplay videos on page load. They do this to save user bandwidth (which costs users money) being wasted on videos which the user doesn't want to watch.</p>

<p>Some browsers may still allow videos to autoplay on load, but this is not a good user experience!</p>

<p>We need to find a better way to trigger video playback.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">Scrawl-canvas event listeners</h3>

<p>In the previous lesson <i>("Build the Tower of Hanoi game")</i> we met some Scrawl-canvas event listeners. To recap, Scrawl-canvas only needs to worry about 5 user interactions, and does work behind the scenes to gather all these different event types into clusters for each interaction type:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><b>enter</b> &ndash; for <code><b>mouseenter, touchenter, pointerenter</b></code> events</li>
  <li><b>move</b> &ndash; for <code><b>mousemove, touchmove, touchfollow, pointermove</b></code> events</li>
  <li><b>down</b> &ndash; for <code><b>mousedown, touchstart, pointerdown</b></code> events</li>
  <li><b>up</b> &ndash; for <code><b>mouseup, touchend, pointerup</b></code> events (which can also be interpreted as user click events)</li>
  <li><b>leave</b> &ndash; for <code><b>mouseleave, touchleave, pointerleave</b></code> events</li>
</ul>

<p>While this is all good for mouse and touch events, what about people using assistive technology? We also need to prepare and play the video for people interacting with the page using their keyboards.</p>

<p>We can achieve this by using <i>native event listeners</i>. Scrawl-canvas includes a <code><b>scrawl.addNativeListener</b></code> function which takes similar inputs to the <code><b>addListener</b></code> functions. We'll add an event listener to the code to trigger our playback now:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  const myvideo = scrawl.makePicture({

    [...]

  });

  <b>const initialVideoStart = scrawl.addNativeListener(
    ['mouseup', 'touchend', 'keyup'],
    () => {

      myvideo.set({

        <ins>// Mute and loop the video before we start playback</ins>
        video_muted: true,
        video_loop: true,
        
      })<b>.videoPlay()</b>;

      <ins>// Get rid of the event listener after invocation - it's a one-time-only action
       // - The addListener factory function returns a function, not an object
       // - Invoking that function removes the event listener(s) from the ‹canvas› element</ins>
      initialVideoStart();

    },
    canvas.domElement
  );</b>

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>Now when we load the page, the error has gone. Clicking (or tapping) on the canvas starts the video playback. Further clicks do nothing because we remove the event listeners after they run.</p>

<p>This deals with our initial problem &ndash; getting the video to display in the canvas as it plays &ndash; but it is not a good user experience. How does the user know that they need to click on the canvas to get things going?</p>

<p>Native ‹video› elements can include controls. But switching on those controls for our video will do no good; the ‹canvas› element captures only the image data: it ignores all the <i>furnishings</i> surrounding the video.</p>

<p>We need to build some controls. We'll do this using Label entitys.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">Artefact event functions</h3>

<p>We met the <b>Label entity</b> in the first lesson. We'll add two to our canvas: one to control video play/pause functionality; the other to switch the video's audio track on and off. For now we'll just code up the play button:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  [... video Picture entity]

  [... initialization event listener]

  <b>const playPause = scrawl.makeLabel({

    name: name('button-play-pause'),
    order: 2,

    start: ['75%' 'bottom'],
    handle: ['center', 'bottom'],

    text: 'PLAY',

    fontString: '2rem sans-serif',
    letterSpacing: 2,
    fillStyle: 'yellow',

  });</b>

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-04/04.png" alt="A canvas dispalying the first frame of a video, with play/pause Label entity at the bottom" /></p>

<p>As it currently stands, our Label entity is just pixels on the screen. The user cannot interact with it.</p>

<p>For instance, how does the user know that clicking on PLAY will trigger an action?</p>

<p>With normal HTML links and buttons, the user can be made aware that the words or images are actionable by adding tooltips to them, or by changing the mouse pointer's cursor. Often, links will also be underlined.</p>

<p>We can do this in Scrawl-canvas using <b>artefact event functions</b>.</p>

<p>Every artefact object includes four attributes to which we can attach functions (which can be changed at any time). These are:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><code><b>onEnter</b></code> &ndash; will trigger when the user moves the mouse cursor over the artefact</li>
  <li><code><b>onDown</b></code> &ndash; will trigger when the user presses the main mouse button while hovering over the artefact</li>
  <li><code><b>onUp</b></code> &ndash; will trigger when the user releases the main mouse button while hovering over the artefact</li>
  <li><code><b>onLeave</b></code> &ndash; will trigger when the user moves the mouse cursor away from the artefact</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's change the mouse cursor to a pointer when the user hovers over our Label entity, and add an underline to the text:</p>

<pre><code>const playPause = scrawl.makeLabel({

  name: name('button-play-pause'),
  order: 2,

  start: ['75%' 'bottom'],
  handle: ['center', 'bottom'],

  text: 'PLAY',

  fontString: '2rem sans-serif',
  letterSpacing: 2,
  fillStyle: 'yellow',

  <ins>// Underlines are difficult - these values will often differ depending on the font</ins>
  <b>underlineWidth: 4,
  underlineOffset: 0.96,
  underlineGap: 0,

  <ins>// These changes get applied when user starts hovering over the Label entity</ins>
  onEnter: function () {

    <ins>// We can change the ‹canvas› element's cursor style
     // - by updating its inline CSS cursor value</ins>
    canvas.set({
      css: {
        cursor: 'pointer',
      }
    });

    this.set({
      includeUnderline: true,
    });
  },

  <ins>// When user stops hovering over the Label entity, we reverse the changes</ins>
  onLeave: function () {

    canvas.set({
      css: {
        cursor: 'auto'
      }
    });

    this.set({
      includeUnderline: false,
    });
  },</b>
});
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is, on its own, not enough to make the magic happen. This is because our Label entity is not part of the DOM event management system. It's just a set of instructions for drawing graphical text onto a ‹canvas› element.</p>

<p>The ‹canvas› element is, however, part of the DOM event management system, because it is an element living in the web page document. To trigger our functionality, we can add an event listener to the ‹canvas› element which invokes a function that will then cascade the event down to our Label entity:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  [... video Picture entity]

  [... initialization event listener]

  [... define Label entitys]

  <b>scrawl.addListener(
    'move', 
    () => canvas.cascadeEventAction('move'), 
    canvas.domElement 
  );</b>

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-04/05.png" alt="A canvas dispalying the first frame of a video - the play button is underlined" /></p>

<p>All looks good so far. Let's make our Label entity interactive. We do this using the <code><b>onUp</b></code> artefact event function:</p>

<pre><code><b>const playPauseAction = function () {

  if (myvideo.get('video_paused')) {

    playPause.set({ text: 'PAUSE' });
    myvideo.videoPlay();
  }
  else {

    playPause.set({ text: 'PLAY' });
    myvideo.videoPause();
  }
};</b>

const playPause = scrawl.makeLabel({

  [...]

  <b>onUp: playPauseAction,</b>

});
</code></pre>

<p>Again, these functions won't trigger on their own. We need to tell the ‹canvas› element that user <b>click</b> events need to be cascaded down to our entitys.</p>

<p>We could use <code><b>scrawl.addListener</b></code> for this. But Scrawl events only cover mousedown and mouseup events. While a click event does indeed fire a mouseup event as part of its functionality, <b><i>click events and mouseup events are not the same thing</i></b>.</p>

<p>Scrawl-canvas allows us to capture native events, like click, using its <code><b>scrawl.addNativeListener</b></code> function &ndash; which follows the same usage pattern.</p>

<p>While we're at it, we'll amend the <code><b>videoPlay</b></code> invocation we included in our initialization event, as play/pause functionality is handled by our Label entity:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  [... video Picture entity]

  const initialVideoStart = scrawl.addNativeListener(
    ['mouseup', 'touchend', 'keyup'],
    () => {

      myvideo.set({
        video_muted: true,
        video_loop: true,

      })<b><s>.videoPlay();</s></b>

      initialVideoStart();
    },
    canvas.domElement,
  );

  [... define Label entitys]

  [... user interaction event listeners]

  <b>scrawl.addNativeListener(
    ['click', 'touchend'], 
    () => canvas.cascadeEventAction('up'), 
    canvas.domElement,
  );</b>

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>There's one big issue we haven't addressed in the above work: <b>accessibility</b>. People navigating the web page using keyboards also need to start the video playing, and stopping it.</p>

<p>Scrawl-canvas handles this sort of interactivity by adding hidden ‹button› elements to the ‹canvas› element. This happens in the background; all we need to do is include some code to the Label entity to define its hidden button:</p>

<pre><code>const playPause = scrawl.makeLabel({

  [...]

  <b>button: {

    <ins>// The button's 'name' value is used as the hidden element's 'id' attribute</ins>
    name: name('play-pause-el'),

    <ins>// The 'description' value is the text placed between the button element's tags
    // - This is important to include for people using screen readers!</ins>
    description: 'Play | Pause',

    <ins>// The 'clickAction' value (in this case) is the same function that we used for 'onUp'</ins>
    clickAction: playPauseAction,

    <ins>// The tab order is also important for keyboard navigators</ins>
    tabOrder: 0,
  },</b>
});
</code></pre>

<p>For the final step in this section, we'll add a second button to trigger LISTEN and MUTE for the video's audio output. We can do this by cloning the playPause Label entity:</p>

<pre><code>const playPause = scrawl.makeLabel({
  [...]
});

<b>const listenMuteAction = function () {

  if (myvideo.get('video_muted')) {

    listenMute.set({ text: 'MUTE' });
    myvideo.set({ video_muted: false });
  }
  else {

    listenMute.set({ text: 'LISTEN' });
    myvideo.set({ video_muted: true });
  }
};

const listenMute = playPause.clone({

    name: name('listen-mute-button'),
    text: 'LISTEN',
    startX: '25%',
    button: {
        name: name('listen-mute-el'),
        description: 'Listen | Mute',
        clickAction: listenMuteAction,
        tabOrder: 1,
    },
    onUp: listenMuteAction,
});</b>
</code></pre>

<h3 tabindex="0">Tracking video playback progress</h3>

<p>One of the joys of webpage-based videos is watching the progress bar move forwards as the video plays. It's also nice to see how many seconds of the video has played, and how long the video lasts.</p>

<p>We'll add that functionality to our canvas, using <b>Block entitys</b> and a render animation <b>Display cycle hook</b>.</p>

<p>There's nothing here that we haven't seen before, except for the <code><b>myvideo.get()</b></code> invocations in our <code><b>videoTimeBar</b></code> hook function:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  [... canvas setup]

  [... video Picture entity]

  [... initialization event listener]

  const vtTime = vtBackground.clone({

    name: name('video-time-bar'),

    width: 0,
    fillStyle: 'red',
  });

  const vtLabel = scrawl.makeLabel({

    name: name('test-video-time-label'),

    accessibleTextRole: 'timer',
  });

  <strong>const videoTimeBar</strong> = function () {

    let currentVideoTime,
      videoDuration;

    return function () {

      currentVideoTime = <b>myvideo.get('video_currentTime')</b>;

      if (!videoDuration) videoDuration = <b>myvideo.get('video_duration')</b>;

      if (videoDuration) {

        vtTime.set({

          width: `${(currentVideoTime * 100) / videoDuration}%`,
        });

        vtLabel.set({

          text: `${currentVideoTime.toFixed(2)} / ${videoDuration.toFixed(2)}`,
        });
      }
    };
  }();</b>

  scrawl.makeRender({
    name: name('animation'),
    target: canvas,
    <b><strong>commence: videoTimeBar,</strong></b>
  });

<h3 tabindex="0">Next steps</h3>

<p>Now that we have a video playing in our responsive ‹canvas› element, we can start to do some fun stuff with it.</p>

<p>In the next lesson we'll turn our swans pink and add an accessible, clickable link to them.</p>
