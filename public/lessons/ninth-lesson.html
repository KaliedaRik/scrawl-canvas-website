<h3 tabindex="0">Many apologies</h3>

<p>We have made the decision to re-write this lesson - the work is currently in progress.</p>

<p>The lesson will cover how we can use Scrawl-canvas to code up self-contained, modularized code which can then be imported into other files to create a specific effect. The plan is to write up a lesson around <a target="_BLANK" href="../demo/modules-002.html">Demo modules-002</a>, which uses <a target="_BLANK" href="../docs/demo/modules/wikipedia-views-spiral-chart.html">modularized code</a> to get data from the <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/">Wikipedia's Public REST API</a> about a given page's views over a period of time and build a chart using that data, which can then be returned to the calling code for display.</p>

<p>For now, please move on to Lesson 11, where we conduct an extended investigation into &lt;canvas> element accessibility.</p>
