<h3 tabindex="0">Compositing and blending</h3>

<p>The ‹canvas› element's 2D rendering context's <a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing/">compositing and blending</a> attributes &ndash; <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalAlpha">globalAlpha</a></b> and <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation">globalCompositeOperation</a></b> &ndash; are seriously useful tools which we can use to build complex, interactive canvas displays.</p>

<p>In Scrawl-canvas, every entity we define can be given its own alpha and compositing values. We can also apply alpha and composite/blending values at the Cell level, to be used when those Cells stamp themselves onto the canvas wrapper's base Cell.</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li>The <b>globalAlpha</b> (GA) attribute is pretty simple to use: setting the value to <code><b>0.0</b></code> will make the entity or Cell entirely transparent; a value of <code><b>1.0</b></code> renders the object onto the canvas as-is. We don't need to explore this attribute any further.</li>
  <li>The <b>globalCompositeOperation</b> (GC) attribute is more difficult to come to terms with, though using it is as easy as using <code><b>globalAlpha</b></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for the confusion is partly to do with the way the different GC operations combine both compositing and blending into their output.</p>

<p>But browser vendors also have to take part of the blame, because of the way they have implemented the standards: for a long time various GC operations had different outputs on different browsers, and some browsers failed to support some of the core operations.</p>

<p>Support for the standards has improved massively in recent years, but it's always worth checking a Scrawl-canvas (or, indeed, <i>any</i> canvas) display which uses GC operations across a range of browsers and devices ... just in case.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">The magnifier effect</h3>

<p>The effect we will be building was (and maybe still is) popular on many shopping sites in the mid-2010s. The user hovers their mouse over an image and a magnified portion of that image appears &ndash; either over the image or alongside it. <a href="https://onextrapixel.com/javascript-image-magnification-plugins/">Many code libraries and plugins</a> have been developed over the years to make implementing the effect as easy as possible for developers.</p>

<p>For this project we shall use our basic html page setup, together with a couple of static images &ndash; one three times the dimensions of the other. None of this code should come as a surprise if you've worked through the previous lessons:</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">Breaking up the work</h3>

<p>So ... what work do we actually need to do?</p>

<ol class="ordered">
  <li>Two Picture entitys: one for the background using the smaller image as its source, and the second for the magnifier effect &ndash; this will use the big image for its source.</li>
  <li>Magnifier Picture to track the mouse as it crosses the canvas.</li>
  <li>The image in the magnifier needs to reflect its Picture entity's current position over canvas.</li>
  <li>Magnifier Picture should hide itself when user's mouse is not hovering over the canvas.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's code up the first two points together:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›

  [... canvas setup]

  <b>scrawl.makePicture({

    name: name('background'),

    asset: 'small-angels',

    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',

    copyWidth: '100%',
    copyHeight: '100%',

  }).clone({

    name: name('enlarged'),

    asset: 'big-angels',

    width: 160,
    height: 160,

    copyWidth: 160,
    copyHeight: 160,

    handleX: 'center',
    handleY: 'center',

    <strong>lockTo: 'mouse',</strong>

    lineWidth: 5,
    strokeStyle: 'gold',

    method: 'fillThenDraw',
  });</b>

  [... render animation]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-07/02.png" alt="Canvas displaying smaller image as background, with smaller inset of the larger image which moves as the mouse moves" /></p>

<p>There's nothing special here about our Picture definitions. But if we move our mouse over the canvas, we'll see our magnifier Picture center itself on the mouse cursor, tracking it as it moves.</p>

<p>How are we doing this?</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">The secrets of 'lockTo'</h3>

<p>The answer is in the magnifier entity's <code><b>lockTo</b></code> attribute, which we have set to the String value <code><b>'mouse'</b></code>.</p>

<p>The <code><b>lockTo</b></code> attribute controls how an artefact/entity will position itself on the canvas. It accepts one of five different String values:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><code><b><strong>'start'</strong></b></code> &ndash; this is the default value. Artefacts will position themselves &ndash; either <i>absolutely</i> or <i>relatively</i> &ndash; in line with the values given in their <code><b>startX, startY, handleX, handleY</b></code> attributes.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'pivot'</strong></b></code> &ndash; we met pivots in the "Tower of Hanoi" lesson. This is where we tell our artefact to position itself <b>with reference to</b> another artefact's start values.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'mimic'</strong></b></code> &ndash; is a more nuanced form of the <code><b>pivot</b></code> concept. For instance we can instruct an artefact to use another artefact's <code><b>width, height</b></code> attributes for its own dimensions.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'path'</strong></b></code> &ndash; use a <b>Shape entity</b>'s path to determine our artefact's position on the canvas. We'll meet Shape entitys in a future lesson.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'mouse'</strong></b></code> &ndash; make the artefact position itself with reference to the mouse cursor's position over the canvas.</li>
</ul>

<p><code><b>lockTo</b></code> can be updated at any time, allowing us to respond to user interaction quickly. We can also specify different lock values for the artefact's horizontal and vertical positioning using the <code><b>lockXTo</b></code> and <code><b>lockYTo</b></code> <i>pseudo-attributes</i> when invoking the <code><b>set</b></code> function on the artefact.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">The mysteries of 'here'</h3>

<p>We need to update the magnifier's image to magnify the background that it currently covers. This means that we need to update the entity's <code><b>copyStartX</b></code> and <code><b>copyStartY</b></code> attributes each time the user moves the mouse.</p>

<p>Artefact event functions offer no solution to this problem because those event listeners do not track mouse coordinate changes. Instead, we need to tap into Scrawl-canvas's <b>here</b> system.</p>

<p>Scrawl-canvas automatically monitors mouse movements, scroll events, and window resize events by attaching event listeners for those events to the browser's window. Each time one of those events triggers a flag gets set and, once every <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a>, Scrawl-canvas checks the flag and updates the <code><b>here</b></code> objects of all subscribed canvas wrappers.</p>

<p>... Not that we need to know any of that. The practical outcome is that we can use our canvas's <code><b>here</b></code> object to find out whether the mouse cursor is curently over the ‹canvas› element, and where it is in the canvas relative to its top-left corner:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›

  [... canvas setup]

  [... define Picture entitys]

  <b>const report = function () {

    const <b>displayed = canvas.here,
      hidden = canvas.base.here,</b>
      testMessage = document.querySelector('#reportmessage');

    return function () {

      testMessage.textContent = `
Display canvas mouse - x: ${<strong>displayed.x</strong>}, y: ${<strong>displayed.y</strong>}
Base canvas mouse - x: ${<strong>hidden.x</strong>}, y: ${<strong>hidden.y</strong>}`;
    };
  }();</b>

  scrawl.makeRender({
    name: name('animation'),
    target: canvas,

    <b>afterShow: report,</b>
  });
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code shows something interesting: the mouse coordinates over our ‹canvas› element are not the same as the coordinates for its base Cell (where all the drawing takes place). Remember that a ‹canvas› element and its base canvas do not need to be the same size; to cope with this, Scrawl-canvas takes into account the size and positioning differences between the two so that they match in <i>relative</i> terms.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-07/03.png" alt="Image shows that the canvas mouse coordinates are not the same as that canvas's base cell's coordinates" /></p>

<p>With this information, we're now in a position to update our magnifier's image data:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›

  [... canvas setup]

  <b>const <b>mybackground =</b> scrawl.makePicture({

    name: name('background'),

    [...]
  });

  const <b>myMagnifierImage =</b> mybackground.clone({

    name: name('enlarged'),

    [...]
  });</b>

  [... report function]

  <b>const <strong>checkMagnifier =</strong> function () {

    let <strong>display, base;</strong>

    return function () {

      if (!display) <strong>display = canvas.here;</strong>
      if (!base) <strong>base = canvas.base.here;</strong>

      const <b>active = display.active;</b>

      <ins>// We can add code to display or hide our magnifier here
       // - using the artefact visibility attribute
       // - canvas.here.active is true when mouse cursor is over the ‹canvas› element </ins>
      myMagnifierImage.set({

        <strong>visibility: (active) ? true : false,</strong>
      });

      if (<strong>active</strong>) {

        myMagnifierImage.set({

          <ins>// This calculation works because we know:
           // - The natural sizes of the small and large images
           // - The size of the base canvas
           // - The dimensions of the magnifier entity</ins>
          copyStartX: (<strong>base.x</strong> * 3) - 80,
          copyStartY: (<strong>base.y</strong> * 3) - 80,
        });
      }
    };
  }();</b>

  scrawl.makeRender({
    name: name('animation'),
    target: canvas,

    <b>commence: checkMagnifier,</b>
    afterShow: report,
  });
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-07/04.png" alt="Canvas showing final user-interactive magnifier effect" /></p>

<h3 tabindex="0">Using a round magnifier</h3>

<p>As the code stands, we've met all our objectives: we can see a zoomed image in a box when the user moves their mouse over the ‹canvas› element.</p>

<p><strong><i>But what if the client wants the magnifier to be a circle?</i></strong></p>

<p>By definition, Picture entitys have a rectangular shape: there's no way to change this.</p>

<p>But this is not a barrier, because we can use GC operations to change how our Picture gets stamped onto the canvas.</p>

<p>To fix this particular issue, we can set our Picture's <code><b>globalCompositeOperation</b></code> attribute to <code><b>'source-in'</b></code> and then stamp it on top of a Wheel entity that we create to act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)">clip zone</a> for our magnifier:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›

  [...]

  const mybackground = scrawl.makePicture({

    [...]

    <ins>// temporarily switch off the background so we can see the effect</ins>
    <b>visibility: false,</b>
  });

  const myMagnifierImage = mybackground.clone({

    [...]

    <ins>// The order in which entitys get stamped is now important</i>
     // - the magnified Picture must be stamped on top of the Wheel (defined below)</ins>
    <b><strong>order: 2,

    globalCompositeOperation: 'source-in',</strong>

    visibility: true,</b>
  });

  <b>scrawl.makeWheel({

    name: name('magnifier'),

    <b>order: 1,</b>

    radius: 80,

    handleX: 'center',
    handleY: 'center',

    <strong>lockTo: 'mouse',</strong>
  });</b>

  [...]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/lesson-07/05.png" alt="Canvas showing global-composition-operation effect" /></p>

<p>The effect works ... but it leaves us with some issues to fix:</p>

<ol class="ordered">
  <li>Our Wheel entity remains visible on the canvas when we move the mouse cursor out of the ‹canvas› element.</li>
  <li>The magnifier has lost its yellow border.</li>
  <li>We have no background image.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two issues can be fixed by adding some Group objects to the mix.</p>

<p>The missing background image can be fixed by using a GC operation called <code><b>'destination-over'</b></code>.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">What are 'source-in' and 'destination-over'?</h3>

<p>The art of image compositing and blending is all about how to combine two images into one. Everything you need to know about how browsers go about the business can be found in the W3C's <a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing/">Compositing and Blending Level 2 Editor's draft</a>.</p>

<p>There's plenty of examples of the range of GC operations available to us, as shown in various web pages scattered across the internet &ndash; the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing/Example">MDN compositing example page</a> is one of the better ones.</p>

<p>We set a GC operation on an entity by supplying its <code><b>globalCompositeOperation</b></code> attribute with a String value ... which must be entirely lowercase! The available options (as defined by W3C) are:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><code>'source-over', 'source-in', 'source-out', 'source-atop'</code></li>
  <li><code>'destination-over', 'destination-in', 'destination-out', 'destination-atop'</code></li>
  <li><code>'copy', 'xor', 'difference', 'exclusion'</code></li>
  <li><code>'multiply', 'screen', 'overlay'</code></li>
  <li><code>'lighter', 'lighten', 'darken', 'hard-light', 'soft-light'</code></li>
  <li><code>'color-dodge', 'color-burn'</code></li>
  <li><code>'hue', 'saturation', 'color', 'luminosity'</code></li>
</ul>

<p>... Finding the exact effect required for the canvas display may need a bit of experimentation. However for our project we only need to worry about a few of the simpler GC operations:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><code><b><strong>'source-over'</strong></b></code> &ndash; this is the default setting. Our entity gets stamped onto the canvas, covering any other entitys already stamped on it. Translucent parts of our entity will allow color from previously stamped entitys to leak through.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'source-in'</strong></b></code> &ndash; here the entity gets stamped over existing entitys, but any areas of the canvas not already painted will be left transparent.</li>
  <li><code><b><strong>'destination-over'</strong></b></code> &ndash; this is the complement of the default; our entity stamps itself onto the canvas as if it is <i>underneath</i> already-stamped entitys. Translucent areas of the canvas will allow colors from our entity to leak through.</li>
</ul>

<h3 tabindex="0">Cell Group objects</h3>

<p>Before we get on with some more coding, one additional thing.</p>

<p>... We need to talk about Groups.</p>

<p>We met Group objects in the "Tower of Hanoi" lesson. We built those Groups to gather together peg and disc entitys, and used them for checking which disc had been selected for dragging, and which peg the disc had been dragged over.</p>

<p>What we didn't learn in that lesson was that every Cell wrapper (they wrap offscreen ‹canvas› elements) includes a Group object. If we want to stamp an entity onto a displayed ‹canvas› element then we need to add them to that ‹canvas› element's base Cell wrapper's Group object.</p>

<p><b><i>The good news is that, for the most part, we don't need to care about Groups.</i></b></p>

<p>Making our canvas the <b>current canvas</b> before we define the entitys we want to display in that canvas will ensure that entity-Group associations can all take place in the background as we define our entitys:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  import * as scrawl from 'https://unpkg.com/scrawl-canvas@8.10.1';

  const canvas = scrawl.library.canvas.mycanvas;
  const namespace = 'canvas-identifier';
  const name = (n) => `${namespace}-${n}`;

  canvas.set({
    backgroundColor: 'honeydew',
  }).<b><strong>setAsCurrentCanvas();</strong></b>

  [...]
‹/script›
</code></pre>

<p>In the "Tower of Hanoi" game we explicitly assigned entitys to Group objects using each Group's <code><b>addArtefacts</b></code> and <code><b>clearArtefacts</b></code> functions. But the Groups we created were not associated with the canvas's base Cell &ndash; and an entity needs to belong to a Cell's Group if it wants to take part in the Display cycle.</p>

<p>So how could those entitys get themselves stamped onto the canvas?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: <b>an entity can be associated with more than one Group object</b>. When we created our peg and disc entitys they were all assigned to the base Cell's Group, as normal. Then they were <i><b>also assigned</b></i> to the peg and disc Group objects we created using Scrawl-canvas's <code><b>makeGroup</b></code> factory function.</p>

<p>... All this background information might be interesting. But why are we discussing it now?</p>

<p>Here's the key point: <b>a Cell wrapper can have more than one Group associated with it.</b></p>

<p>These Groups can be ordered; they can have filters applied to them. And an entity associated with any of these Groups will be included in the Cell's Display cycle &ndash; as long as the Group's <code><b>visibility</b></code> flag has been set to true (which it is, by default).</p>

<p>Enough talk; more code! Let's create some Groups and assign our entitys to them as we define them:</p>

<pre><code>‹script type="module"›
  import * as scrawl from 'https://unpkg.com/scrawl-canvas@8.10.1';

  const canvas = scrawl.library.canvas.mycanvas,

  <ins>// Note that we are NOT setting the canvas as the current canvas here
   // - instead we shall deal with Group assignments as we define our entitys</ins>
  canvas.set({

  });
